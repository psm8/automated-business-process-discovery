### Simplicity

### Replay fitness
event_group must have fixed length
needlemann-wunsch recurrent and fill matrix
dont have to check next elements in model
nv('pqrklabcdefz', 'zxyabcdefpqr')
nv('klabc', 'abcde')
nv('labcd', 'abcde')
nv('abcde', 'abcde')check also additional ones and add with +1
check next elements in log until more than -1 penalty (-2, -3 , -4)
if eventParallelGroup we still have to solve this for all combinations
### Precision
add info about visited nodes and no of children, could be stored in dictionary created when parsing.
### Generalization
add info about visited nodes and no of children, could be stored in dictionary created when parsing.

merge lop if repetitions

consider if opt should return element length n or 0 to n
